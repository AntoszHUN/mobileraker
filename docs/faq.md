# 🚀 What is Mobileraker?
🏷️ Mobileraker works as a simple UI for Klipper on the phone. Connect it to an existing moonraker installation and control the printer.

# 📷 How do I add a WebCam ?
Out of the box, Mobileraker offers support for any MJPEG webcam streams directly on the dashboard screen. You can add as many webcams as you like on the printer's setting page. To open it, open the navigation bar and press the gear icon at the top, right next to your printer's name. This opens the printer's settings. Scroll down until you reach the webcam section. After you are done adding/editing a webcam please make sure you press save.

- VPN
