## [2.3.0] - 2023-05-19

This release signifies a significant shift in the philosophy governing the future of Mobileraker, particularly regarding
its monetization strategy. However, let me begin by addressing the most crucial aspect. Currently, there are no plans to
restrict major functional features behind paywalls or subscriptionsâ€”Mobileraker will remain open source. Nevertheless,
due to the unsuccessful reliance on donations as the sole funding source and the absence of long-term sponsorship from
any company or shop, the decision has been made to incorporate monetization directly within Mobileraker.

With the introduction of this version, users now have the option to support the ongoing development of Mobileraker
through in-app subscriptions. As a token of appreciation, supporters will gain access to an exclusive Material 3-based
theme. In the future, additional perks such as UI enhancements or minor functional features may be introduced.
