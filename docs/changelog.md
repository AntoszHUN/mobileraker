## [2.3.0] - 2023-05-19

This release signifies a significant shift in the philosophy governing the future of Mobileraker,
particularly regarding
its monetization strategy. However, let me begin by addressing the most crucial aspect. Currently,
there are no plans to
restrict major functional features behind paywalls or subscriptionsâ€”Mobileraker will remain open
source. Nevertheless,
due to the unsuccessful reliance on donations as the sole funding source and the absence of
long-term sponsorship from
any company or shop, the decision has been made to incorporate monetization directly within
Mobileraker.

With the introduction of this version, users now have the option to support the ongoing development
of Mobileraker
through in-app subscriptions. As a token of appreciation, supporters will gain access to an
exclusive Material 3-based
theme. In the future, additional perks such as UI enhancements or minor functional features may be
introduced.

### Major Changes

- Added a new "Support the Dev!" page to facilitate user contributions
- Improved integration by sharing webcam configuration with Mainsail/Fluidd
- Introduced a setting to automatically switch the fullscreen webcam to landscape
  mode ([#95](https://github.com/Clon1998/mobileraker/issues/95))
- Implemented a "Printer Switch" dialog that opens when users tap the page's titlt (Note: Rapid
  printer switching can be
  done by swiping the title)
- Provided a helpful hint in the app settings
  if [mobileraker_companion](https://github.com/Clon1998/mobileraker_companion) is not detected
- Added Romanian translation, thanks to [@vaxxi](https://github.com/vaxxi)
- Added Italian translation, thanks to [@Livex97](https://github.com/Livex97)

### Changed Features

- Added support for printers that do not utilize a print
  fan ([#158](https://github.com/Clon1998/mobileraker/issues/158))
